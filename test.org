**** Lord of the Rings My favoriste scenes are (in this order) 1. The attack of the Rohirrim 2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king + this was already my favorite scene in the book + I really like Miranda Otto. 3. Peter Jackson being shot by legolas _ on DVD only He makes a really fuuny face when it happens. ORG-LIST-END-MARKKER But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole. Important actors in this film are : - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend. I still remember him very well from his role as MIkey Walsh in The Goonies.
